                            With the rising demand in personalisation, human- & care- centricity, patient experience & patient unmet needs are gaining growing tractions and significance during the healthcare solution development. Conventionally, pharmaceutical companies could not have direct connections with patients due to compliances and regulations. The existing digital solutions are siloed and don't follow the same standards, such that there's no interoperability. To revolutionise the customer & patient engagement, our partners in the Medical Affairs team in Japan reached out to the Johnson & Johnson Design (JJD) team to leverage on our expertise in research, patient (Human) experiences, strategy & service design and solution testing & evaluations. <br>The vision, is to synergise the power of data & digitisation, the scalability across TAs, as well as improvements in patient experiences.</p>

                                <p> What we discovered is that patients aren't adhereing to treatments for various reasons, including unbearable side-effects, unable to fit into their schedules, inconvenience at public places, and most common of all, general forgetfulness. Taking into consideration of the behavior design, we factored in some of the related questions into the test planning & surveys. Other test objectives include: </p>
                                    <li> Effectiveness of reminders in medication tracking </li>
                                    <li> Accuracy & effectiveness of a hardware device in medication tracking </li>

                                    <li> Any differences in having regular HCP check-in during medication tracking </li>

                                <p>Overall, while this solution is novice as it combines hardware with a software solution, and the aim is for tracking to be done automatically, such that patient don't need to put in additional effort of logging their medications. However, the experience of use is not smooth, involves manual effort of set-up, accuracy issues etc.; and considering the condition of patients in our target user group (Schizophrenia patients - forgetfulness is a big issue), the solution doesn't prove to solve for that. </p>

                                <p>However, we uncovered other insights, such as how factors like habits & motivations affected the participants behavior, perceptions of HCP & data privacy changes the receptiveness towards certain actions, suggestions on other solutions that could help the participants with additional accountability, etc. </p>

                            While phase 1 & 2 is a wrap, we've established trustworthy partnership with the Japan team and the project is funded for another year. The insights and recommendations are great outputs. However, the project didn't land on a specific solution as the partner expected, and I believe that there're various areas of improvements. <br>
                            During the transition, the key project owner, some JJD members and other Japan team members on this project also changed. Before embarking on the new year, I did a retrospective session with the team to list down all areas for improvements. </p>

Based on the insight report from phase 2, as well as organisation's business priorities & direct access on customer engagements, we re-evaluated the problem space, brought in customers (HCPs) into the ecosystem, and pivoted the focus from medication adherence to HCP-PT communications. </p>

                            <p>This is my first project after joining Johnson & Johnson. The project had a lot of ambiguity & fluidity.
