                            With the rising demand in personalisation, human- & care- centricity, patient experience & patient unmet needs are gaining growing tractions and significance during the healthcare solution development. Conventionally, pharmaceutical companies could not have direct connections with patients due to compliances and regulations. To revolutionise the customer & patient engagement, our partners in the Medical Affairs team in Japan reached out to the Johnson & Johnson Design (JJD) team to leverage on our expertise in research, patient (Human) experiences, strategy & service design and solution testing & evaluations.</p>

                            <p>One of the important aspect where design & development are intertwined, is the scalability considerations. We used the analogy of a "Shopping mall" as an internal reference, to illustrate how the different product squads collaborate & contribute to the platform that functions as a "mall".</p>

                            <p>Although most of the work mainly evolved one key screen, the project was a close collaboration with multiple teams in my company, including my squad on My Singtel app, the Lifestyle Service chapter and the Design Language System chapter. 
                                And thanks to the support of my manager, director and POs, we were able to get the stakeholders' buy-in quickly and moved the pieces forward rapidly enough.</p>

                            <p>As one of the first independently led projects that impacts a broad
                                range of users, this project has seen through many decision-making and
                                prioritisation moments. I had to make hard calls and prioritise the MVP
                                features based on testing data, and prepare the opportunity & benefits
                                analysis to get buy-in from various stakeholders. This project was agile,
                                iterative, data-driven, with research highly integrated into the process.</p>

                            <h6>Communications</h6>
                            <p>Stakeholder meetings are not the easiest to manage - the higher rank the other parties are, the lesser patience and time
                                they have to offer. It is critical to highlight the key points, backed up with solid proof and data, and communicate the ideas
                                through quickly.</p>
                            <div class="h-30"></div>

                            <h6>Iterations</h6>
                            <p>There’s no endpoint to any sort of perfectionism - we designers of all people should know that very well. Pixel perfect is not
                                the most efficient way to move a project forward. It is critical to know when to push for fine details, and when to look at the
                                overall strategy.</p>
                            <div class="h-30"></div>

                            <h6>Agile</h6>
                            <p>Working in agile means many things - although it may sounds
                                “fast”, the backlog constantly evolve. Initially planned for Q3
                                FY20, the project was delayed till Q1 FY21. What we can do, is to quickly respond to changes,
                                and prepare the necessary details till the time comes.</p>
                            <div class="h-30"></div>

                            <h6>Business budgeting</h6>
                            <p>This is one of the most recent learnings I've had. The organisation was undergoing some re-org recently, and the initial business owner of the project changed as a result of the restructuring.
                                Although this does not impact the squad directly, there're changes in terms of budget allocation & roadmap planning. Instead of a consolidated centralised budget of development, the project is 
                            most likely being compartmentalised into key features, and get funded via the various stakeholders who benefit from the respective features. <br> This process is relatively new to me. 
                            It was shared to me by the new PO of the squad, something that influences the business prioritisations, and hence the MVP customer journeys to some extend. 
                            To me, it is critical for designers to get involved in such processes, stay on top of the product development progress, and being able to pivot and respond quickly to fit the need of the golden trio. </p>
