                            With the rising demand in personalisation, human- & care- centricity, patient experience & patient unmet needs are gaining growing tractions and significance during the healthcare solution development. Conventionally, pharmaceutical companies could not have direct connections with patients due to compliances and regulations. The existing digital solutions are siloed and don't follow the same standards, such that there's no interoperability. To revolutionise the customer & patient engagement, our partners in the Medical Affairs team in Japan reached out to the Johnson & Johnson Design (JJD) team to leverage on our expertise in research, patient (Human) experiences, strategy & service design and solution testing & evaluations. <br>The vision, is to synergise the power of data & digitisation, the scalability across TAs, as well as improvements in patient experiences.</p>

                                <p> What we discovered is that patients aren't adhereing to treatments for various reasons, including unbearable side-effects, unable to fit into their schedules, inconvenience at public places, and most common of all, general forgetfulness. Taking into consideration of the behavior design, we factored in some of the related questions into the test planning & surveys. Other test objectives include: </p>
                                    <li> Effectiveness of reminders in medication tracking </li>
                                    <li> Accuracy & effectiveness of a hardware device in medication tracking </li>
                                    <li> Any differences in using software for medication tracking </li>
                                    <li> Any differences in having regular HCP check-in during medication tracking </li>
                                    <li> Other factors that affected the participants' behaviors </li>

                                <p>Overall, while this solution is novice as it combines hardware with a software solution, and the aim is for tracking to be done automatically, such that patient don't need to put in additional effort of logging their medications. However, the experience of use is not smooth, involves manual effort of set-up, accuracy issues etc.; and considering the condition of patients in our target user group (Schizophrenia patients - forgetfulness is a big issue), the solution doesn't prove to solve for that. </p>

                                <p>However, we uncovered other insights, such as how factors like habits & motivations affected the participants behavior, perceptions of HCP & data privacy changes the receptiveness towards certain actions, suggestions on other solutions that could help the participants with additional accountability, etc. </p>

                            <h6>Project planning - Establish clear goal, even with ambiguity</h6>
                            <p>This is my first project after joining Johnson & Johnson - dived straight in right after the first day. The project had a lot of ambiguity & fluidity. For example, the role of my team was never clearly defined, which allowed us to broaden scope & stretch the influence of Design with flexibility and in various roles & responsibilities. </p>
                            <div class="h-10"></div>    

                            <p>This is also my first experience to lead while working with the business stakeholders in partnerships. It took a while of defining & adapting my role at the beginning of the project to get used to this working model. Beyond leading a small team, phase 3 of the project has seen my growth in autonomously leading & guiding the partner discussions, hosting workshops, as well as shaping the project directions. </p>
                            <div class="h-10"></div>    
                            
                            <p>The project expanded my workscope to design strategy during business problem & solution definition - which has also been my target growth area for 2021. While the ambiguity of the project can be unnerving at times, it has been a great and rapid learning opportunity to identify my own patterns, methods, approaches & mental models in strategic projects.  </p>

                            <h6>Processes - Onboarding </h6>
                            <p>Proper project onboarding is critical. The process itself requires user-centricity design. For example, who are we intending to onboard, and how much prior knowledge do they have? <br> My own onboarding process to the project was a steep learning curve, with no prior pharmatheutical nor J&J knowledge, and only one onboarding session. <br> Project that has a strategic focus is harder to explain and handover, compared to those with very visible outputs. Sometimes it takes effort to explain the development of project and the decision making process inbetween. <br> Proper documentation, clear explanations, and no presumption on the audience is very critical. </p>

                            <h6>Processes - Diverge, but not too much </h6>
                            <p>Partially due to the ambuiguity, undefined project deliverables, and general amitiousness, the discovery process took a long while and many twists and turns. The diverge and converge process happened various times - looking at medical adherences, relevant solutions, broader problem space, common opportunity areas, etc. There was a tendency to wish to tackle too many problems in one go - which resulted in a high time expenditure on insights that weren't used in the later part of the project.  </p>

                            <h6>Communications - working with remote teams & cultural nuances</h6>
                            <p>We were very grateful of the project partners in Japan - the partners are very willing to listen and hear us out. Communication was not easy. Most sessions require interpretors and pre-work. During my 1-1 with direct counter-parts, it was easy to observe that only 60% of information get translated and delivered. There were a lot of clarifications during the sessions. While presenting ideas in English, we also tend to forget that translations in Japanese has longer sentence structure. <br> It takes a while to get used to the effective pace and contents of communications. Cultural nuances would also need to be taken into considerations, such as preparing apt activities and sharing sessions in workshops, so we could receive adequate share-outs from Japanese colleagues.   </p>

                            <h6>Activities - Hosting workshops </h6>
                            <p>We hosted a lot of remote workshops in this project. Normally, my first instinct in planning workshops is to FILL IN a session with planned activities and contents. We tend to overlook the importance of pauses and breaks, pace and emotional energy. Breaks in workshops are as cirtical as negative spaces in architecture, without which the session would not be a comprehensive experience. Emotional energy are like circulations that guides the flow of communications & discussion. It need to be smooth, diverse, feels natural and fluent for collaborative sessions, or attention grabbing enough for structured share-outs. </p>
