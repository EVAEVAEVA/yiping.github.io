                            to Bubble, a metaphorical vocal expression to the shape of the robot. It was later on discovered that "babble" in Dutch means talk or chatter, reflecting its learnbot nature.</p>

                        <p>As seen from the figure above, the system could be divided to four main
                            segments. From physical aspect, it could be divided to hardware and software
                            sections, where hardware includes part that is static (“Hardware”) as well as parts
                            that are functional (“Input” and “Output”). Green boxes in the diagram indicates the

                            design is reflected from two segments of the robot — the user interface board,
                            mainly consists of a touch screen and camera; the hardware designs, where static
                            industrial design, mechanical design and dynamic motion planning comes in.</p>

                                <p>A steady servo (MG995) attached to a rotatory base in combination of two more
                                    servo motors were chosen to construct the robot inner skeleton (Appendix B:
                                    Prototypes). Selection was mainly based on resources available for faster prototype
                                    construction. This allows Babble to have three degrees of freedom: rotation of the
                                    entire body; rotation of its head in two directions, allowing it to nod and wave. It has
                                    a screen in replacement of a physical face. <br><br>
                                    <b>Base & Servo #0.</b>
                                    This is the base servo, the motor for the entire body rotation. Origin of the ground
                                    coordinate rests on plane 0, located at the robot base center. Direction of axes are
                                    
                                    the same as the coordinate directions for servo #0. Rotation axis for servo #0 is Z-
                                    axis, as such, it does not need to overcome external torque imposed by gravity at
                                    
                                    any position. Thus, there is small load requirement for servo #0.
                                    The base where Servo #0 is attached to has a stable structure; it has a for-legged
                                    support that assembles three metallic plates at the same time. One of the plates
                                    mounts servo #0. <br><br>

                                    <b>Body & Servo #1.</b>
                                    Servo #1 accommodates the nodding motion of the robot head, which also
                                    encounters the problem of excessive loading. The rotational axis for servo #1 is in
                                    plane 1, the XY-plane of servo #0. Little deflection of the servo arm results in
                                    significant loading on servo #1. Gravitational force accounts for the largest portion of
                                    the external torque. This directly affect the servo performance, namely, the robot
                                    falls over upon sudden changes of motion or electrifying; the structure could not
                                    
                                    stand straight if the weight above servo #1 is unbalanced. Though the problem is
                                    resolvable through changing servo #1 to one with larger torque inertia, the
                                    
                                    replacement is hard to accomplish in this case, as the entire base section was pre-
                                    assembled such that the structure is only suitable for the size of this type of motor.
                                    
                                    <br><br>
                                    <b>Head & Servo #2.</b>
                                    Servo #2 extends interactivity to a larger scale. The robot head could now sway left
                                    to right. The rotational axis is orthogonal to the screen. With servo #2, the robot
                                    head now has full rotational capability installed. By default, the position of the robot
                                    head has 25 degrees of extension, as shown in the figure above. This is under the
                                    consideration that for most of the interaction, the user’s eye sight comes from a level
                                    above the robot head, an extension would allow the users to view the screens easily.<br><br>
                                    <b>Controller Board & Battery</b>
                                    The controller board available for usage was pcDuino v2 board. This is similar to a
                                    personal-computer, where programs and commands can be loaded to perform
                                    desired operations. The operating system running on the pcDuino was Ubuntu 12.1
                                    by default. In order to support the software requirement by the learning framework,
                                    it was updated to Ubuntu 14.1. The pcDuino has a small dimension of 10.5cm by
                                    5.3cm, easily to be incorporated to the existing robot structure.
                                    The controller board, as well as battery component are most likely to be
                                    incorporated to the base shell segment of the robot. The space between robot base
                                    to the base of servo #0 is currently designed to be filled with plastic translucent
                                    material, both for decoration and supporting purposes. Rechargeable battery could
                                    
                                    be incorporated within the base structure as an extra weight for stability, and the
                                    controller board could be secured on top of the battery.<br><br>
                                    <b>Screen</b>
                                    The screen was selected as a 7’’ Capacitive touch screen (RobotShop, 2016) to allow
                                    touch input from the users. (Appendix C: Babble Prototype) However, due to the
                                    limitations of no existing driver available for enabling touch function on pcDuino, the
                                    previously designed touch interactivity is achieved through reading user’s input from
                                    the keyboard and respond accordingly.
                                    The back of the screen is assembled to servo #2 through a single servo, due to the
                                    unavailability of servo connectors. However, the structure is not steady. Thus, a
                                    supporting “I” frame is proposed to be attached to the bottom of the screen.
                                    Subsequently, the screen and the frame is assembled to the head shell through
                                    small screws and a circular ring frame, and to be further enclosed with organic

                                    <b>Camera Module</b>
                                    Another component not included in the drawing is the camera module. However, it
                                    has been incorporated during the testing stage. As seen from figure 3.3 above, there
                                    is a cavity above servo #2 behind the screen frame in its head compartment. This is
                                    where the camera as well as controller boards for the camera and the screen will be
                                    inserted. The plan for the next step is to fill in the cavity with a proper sized and good
                                    quality camera module.</p>

                            <div class="panel"> 
                                <p>The servos are controllable in two ways — through a motor control program or
                                    through sending in discrete line commands. While testing through the motor control
                                    program, dragging the pointer position could change the rotation of the servo
                                    motors respectively. <br>A set of actions were determined for the robot through this
                                    program. Actions including “casual looking”, “smile/happy”, “nodding”, “look left” and
                                    “look right” etc. were incorporated.<br><br>
                                    In order for the motors to rotate while connected to pcDuino, line command is
                                    needed for motion control. The format for a line command is:<br>
                                    <mark id="formula">#0P1500T1000 /r/n </mark><br>
                                    The respective position of each servo at robot initial position:<br>

                                    Servo #0: P 1500 Servo #1: P 1130 Servo #2: P1580 <br><br>

                                    If the desired action is a nodding action:
                                    <mark id="formula">
                                    //Initial position #1 at P1130 <br>

                                    #1P1280T1000 /r/n <br>
                                    #1P1050T1000 /r/n <br>
                                    #1P1130T1000 /r/n <br>
                                    </mark><br>
                                    This could be easily interpreted. Range of action for for nodding action is to control
                                    servo #1 from P1050 to P1280. Starting from its initial position, servo #1 would go
                                    up 150 steps to P1280 in 1s, then move downward to P1050 in 1s, then return to its
                                    initial position in 1s. <br><br>

                                    To list an example for a more complicated smiling action: <br>
                                    <mark id="formula">
                                        //Starting from Initial position <br>

                                        #2P1700T700 /r/n <br><br>
                                        //Moved to designated position in 0.7s <br>

                                        #1P1130T500<br>
                                        #2P1580T500 /r/n<br><br>
                                        //Return to initial position in 0.5s<br>
                                        </mark><br>
                                    
                                    
                                    Do notice that “/r/n” only occurred after sending in command for all three servos.
                                    The commands for multiple servos are interpreted by the controller as one whole
                                    command, which could be processed at the same time. The replication of code from
                                    the first to the second command block segment is because the action requires the
                                    robot to pause at the designated position for a while, in order to make the effect
                                    more realistic. There the pause, robot is returned to initial position.</p>

                                    Though unable to create 3D models, it could add gradient to shapes instead to
                                    create depth to the animation. The biggest advantage of adopting Animate CC is its

                                As seen from the illustration above, the figures are elastic and vivid. “Wired” is
                                designed to express a feeling of awkward or surprise, or when there are too many
                                things to learn that it is unable to handle. As the eye-bulbs approaches each other
                                very rapidly, they look like sticking together, being squeezed and bouncing back to
                                the side again. <br><br>
                                
                                The “Happy” expression is also interesting. As seen from above, isolating the last two
                                thumbnails may lead to an impression of arrogant or angry. However, while playing
                                in a smoothed sequence, the expression looks lovely and projects a satisfying smile. <br><br>
                                Thus, it is significant to view the expression sequence as a whole instead of isolating
                                any key frame and look at them individually.</p>

                                requirement. From the data of World Health Organization, girls from this age range
                                have a height of 109 - 145cm, and boys from 110 - 143cm on average (WHO, 2016). <br> An estimation of 45 - 60 cm of arm length is estimated for age
                                group of 5 - 11, correlates with the data from TUDelft. <br> These data matters with the design of the robot especially when it comes to human-
                                robot interaction. Overall, the robot is 40.8 cm in height. At its natural position, the

                                ranges from 110cm to 145cm, desk height ranges from 55~65 cm for children of this
                                age, and 65~75 cm for adults. The optimum angle for a single view position ranges
                                from 10 degree above standard line of sight in the horizontal direction, as well as 45

                        <p>When the research was done in 2015,
                            depression was predicted to be the
                            second major cause to disability by
                            2020 (which is now!). Based on an
                            early article by WHO this year, suicide
                            is the second leading cause of death
                            in 15-29-year olds. A category of
                            depression, social anxiety disorder
                            (DSM-5), typically occurs among
                            adolescents between 13-18. Similar
                            symptoms may also occur in children
                            mainly from 3-6, categorised as
                            selective mutism. The symptoms
                            include difficulty in interpersonal
                            communications, impaired social skills
                            and fear of public speaking. However,
                            these remain highly unidentified among
                            many young people, as the symptoms
                            could also be interpreted as shyness,
                            and these children could behave
                            normally at home.
                            Prevention programs and interventions
                            have shown to be useful to reduce
                            depression.<br> 
                            Dew is a robot developed specifically for these group of young people, though it
                            could also be used for people enduring mild depression. It is not a cure or therapy,
                            but rather an emotional companion or support, to assist the emotional regulations
                            of the users. Major focus of the design is to empower the emotional communication
                            with the users.</p>

                        <p>Major input from the user comes from two dimensions:
                            touch and camera-capture. Through the sensors embedded in the robot skin,
                            touches from user will be analysed for their interaction mode and emotional status,
                            whereas motion and user expressions are captured through the installed cameras.
                            Output of the robot includes conducting photo/videography, giving musical
                            responses, expressing of emotional states through LED changes as well as
                            responding through motional changes. The I/O conversion is achievable through the
                            hardware installed inside the robot, which includes various sensors, cameras,
                            microphone, LED lights as well as motors to enable its motion.</p>

                                <p>Structurally, Dew includes two major compartments – physical motion system and
                                    interactive I/O system. Motion system is where physical movement determines
                                    responses and interactions. Both its body and top-cap are capable of rotation. Dew
                                    is able to track and follow position of users through changes in its orientations. The
                                    mobility is achieved through two servomotors, one installed at the base that controls
                                    body-motion, the other at the body-cap intersection to control rotation of its tip.
                                    The interactive I/O system is where other functionalities are processed. Input
                                    system includes two stereo cameras as well as various sensors distributed
                                    throughout the robot body. Output system includes LED headlight, LED lining as
                                    battery status indicator, as well as LED interior for expressional responses;
                                    microphone for audio responses; motion also assists in expressing its responses. To
                                    ensure the output responses are emotional, Dew would be incorporated with a
                                    software engine that is able to analyse user’s expression and gestures, process the
                                    data from sensors and cameras simultaneously, and give a correspondent response
                                    through the musical, motional and expressional reactions.<br>

                                    Two main types of sensors are incorporated, including
                                    positional and bio- sensors. Position sensors calculates how the user interacts
                                    through changes in Dew’s relative position. More accurate data could be generated
                                    by combing the input captured through the camera. Bio-sensors include
                                    temperature, skin conductivity (SC) and blood volume pulses (BVP) sensors.<br>
                                    
                                    Researches have found that unimodal sensors is not accurate in detecting emotion-
                                    related variations because the result varies among individuals and the would
                                    fluctuate on a single person with one modality (Kim, 2007). This is the reason why
                                    multiple sensors should be adopted.<br>

                                    Sensors are chosen based on relative effectiveness and accessibility. As the most
                                    common body area the users would use to interact is their hands; data obtainable
                                    from hands is primarily considered. Moreover, SC is commented as the most
                                    effective measure of emotional-physiological relationship. Temperature, heart rate
                                    and pressure are also directly related especially with high arousal of users’ emotional
                                    states (Wagner, Kim, Andre , 2005 ́ ). Hot spots for user input is proposed as top tip
                                    and near-bottom body area. sensors will be mainly implemented in these areas.</p>

                                    from water droplets, plant buds as well
                                    as morning dew, objects that indicates
                                    liveliness, health, energy and happiness.
                                    The smooth and floating outlook
                                    welcomes people to touch and interact.
                                    It feels soft and tender, conveyed
                                    through both the form of its outlook as
                                    well as choices of materials.
                                    One proposal for the material is
                                    translucent low density polyethylene
                                    covered with translucent silicone,
                                    allowing light to pass through, also
                                    gives a tender and warm touch to the
                                    outer layer, allows it easy to hold on to.</p>

                        <p><b>Things to improve:</b><br>After concept generalisation and testing for this project,
                            improvement could be made on design process sequence and
                            efficiency. The process focused too much on the form instead of
                            mechanical structures in the starting stage, leading to problems
                            of hardware incorporation.
                            It should be noted to design for the whole product and focus on
                            entirety before narrowing down to details and specifications. As
                            an example, while focusing too much on each separate
                            segments inside Dew, the dimension of the whole structure was
                            not as good as if the whole structure was taken account for in
                            the first step. Subsequent parts and pieces would need to be
                            designed based on the previous parts, which lead to
                            complications for design in later stages as well.
                            As for the process of prototyping, especially when it is necessary
                            to use time-consuming methods such as 3D printing, a better
                            approach would be to have a rough prototype to test for the
                            product dimension before moving on to production. This is to
                            ensure that the dimension is suitable and desirable, at the same
                            time save significant time by producing a less iteration-required
                            model.</p>

                            <p><b>Gained:</b><br>I've gained invaluable knowledge for emotional design, interaction design and product design; <br>
                                the project allowed me the time and opportunity to learn about the principles and different disciplines of design, and allowed me the freedom to explore; <br> 
                                It has also helped me towards the career transitioning from engineering to design. </p>
