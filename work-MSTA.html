                            <p>We started off by identifying what's not working on the main app today, finding the key gaps and pain points that users are facing, as well as the painpoints and gaps of our backend infrastructure.<br>

                            <h6>I. Conducting research</h6>
                            <p>We gathered some feedback by interviewing a few relationship managers (RMs) in house, as well as sending out a survey to a larger base of RMs in the region, to understand their current workflow based on the existing system, as well as the ideal scenario and their preferences. </p>
                            <div class="h-30"></div>


                            <h6>II. Analysing feedback</h6>
                            <p>As suspected, 80% of the features are underutilised, and the 20% of key information is scattered around and hard to navigate, working effort is duplicated and we are losing a lot of opportunities. Not only is this a bad experience for the users (RMs), but also directly impact the client's experiences.  </p>
                            <div class="h-30"></div>

                            <h6>III. Gathering insights</h6>
                            <P>Based on the research findings, we were able to identify a few top insights: <br>
                                <br> - a list of the top metrics ranked by the RMs
                                <br> - workflow of the RMs 
                                <br> - thinking processes of the RMs 
                                <br> - key information RMs look for when servicing individual clients. </p>
                            <div class="h-30"></div>


                            <h6>IV. Testing ideas</h6>

                            <p>We did some rapid prototyping by recreating a few versions of the dashboard and tested internally for the proof of concepts. We were able to decide on one concept to further iterate and presented to the RMs and business owners a version that is the most simple and easy to use.</p>
                           
                            <div class="h-30"></div>

                            <h6>V. Best teams work together</h6>

                            <p>We were able to pull it off by getting the support from the business owners, the developers as well as our end users - the RMs. Although there were still pushbacks and compromises to be made due to the tight timeline, we were able to see through the changes in their workflow and the restructuring of the front-end system. We received emails from RMs saying that the system became easier to use and they are happy to see the changes. </p>

                            <p>Changes are difficult to make, which is why designers have an even higher responsibility to push for those changes. This is especially true for large corporations and companies that directly impact the life of people. The larger the scale of a corporation, the more essential it is to make decisions wisely and having users at heart when making those decisions. Design in corporations should carry a role of creating positive influences, allowing different teams to see their company's product not only as a revenue generating "machine", but something essential for our users such that they can interact with and benefit from. </p>
