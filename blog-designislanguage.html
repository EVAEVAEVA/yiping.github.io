                            <p>Design is like a language system. <br>

                            I was chatting with a friend the other day, and she was explaining some Japanese basics to me. Having learnt the hardest Chinese language since before I can remember, my experiences with acquiring English & German, both of which belonging to the Germanic branch of Indo-European languages, has been systematic and taken for granted that both started with learning and reading the alphabetic table. <br>

                            Her explanation on Japanese language, however, stoke me with a sudden realization that most languages are formed with a structural and component based system. If you’re on the frontline of the fashionable words of design, you’d hear about the term “atomic design” or “design systems” frequently these days. A language can therefore be interpreted as very much similar to the atomic design system that’s at its apogee today. Especially in the context of a Chinese originated language system, the development of which were very much a visual interpretation of the objects themselves. So not only do these languages have a system and atomic structure, it’s carved out of the symbolic meanings such that the visual metaphors takes the precedence. <br>

                            Take the very famous Chinese character of tree “木”, for example. </p>

                            <p>Structurally, this is how its formed - <br></p>
                                <p>木- One tree is a piece of wood <br>
                                林- Two trees become a grove <br>
                                森- Three trees become a forest (3, a number that always indicate a few/multiple in the ancient Chinese) <br></p>

                                <div class="h-30"></div>
                                <p>If you attach the tree to something else, say “李“, one of the common surnames in Chinese, which always referred to as fruits, specifically plums, in ancient Chinese - <br></p>
                                <p>木- One tree is a piece of wood<br>
                                    子- Son; the child of something<br>
                                    李- (son under the trees) - Fruit from a tree; plums; a surname;  <br></p>

                                <div class="h-30"></div>
                                <p>Another example is “桃“, peaches, a fruit that always used as a prosperous symbol in Chinese culture:<br></p>
                                <p>木- One tree is a piece of wood<br>
                                    兆- Prosperous sigh<br>
                                    桃- (Luck by a tree) - Fruit from a tree; peaches;<br>

                                <p>桃李- the two fruits that we mentioned previously; used together to indicate the “fruits” at harvest - students or mentees from teachers or mentors; <br>
