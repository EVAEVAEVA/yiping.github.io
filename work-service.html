Our Northstar is to create a seamless banking service experience, breaking down the silos between different channels (online, offline etc), no more long hours of waiting or frustrations of couldn't get things done. We want to be smart, “diplomatic”, be there when they need us, and always be helpful. We want to be anticipatory, familiar, lite yet useful. </p>

This helps us to define and plan out the subsequent projects, also to keep us on track with the different features priorities. </p>
