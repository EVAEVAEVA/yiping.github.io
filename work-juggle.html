                                The process was kicked off by doing marketing and background research on the concept of "Financial wellness", to explore the meaning of this term as well as  the different personal finance behaviours across different demographics, country and people with different lifestyles.

                                <p>As geek as I am, I created an equation for measuring how well worth money can be spent on a particular category for different individuals:<br><br>
                                    <mark id="formula">* Discretionary spending worthiness = (Satisfaction longtitude / T ) * (Level of satisfaction / cost);

                                <i>*This is defined by me as a value that may determine whether an item is worth to buy, derived by the longtitude of satisfaction by purchase the item versus the cost of the product. The higher the value, more value is there to buy the product.<br>

                                <p>In order to obtain real user data and behavioural analysis, I created a survey and distributed it among my collegues, friends in Singapore as well as back in China, to understand better about money and themselves.

                                        Limitation: the fact that they dun have much money/many income yet also eliminated problem regarding ‘saving’  along the way.
