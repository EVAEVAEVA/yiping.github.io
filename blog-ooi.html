                            <p>There were multiple things that triggered something in me these few days. <br>
                                1. I was listening to a podcast about how girls went through extreme diets and had to join fitness physique competitions to keep themselves on track. However, they were feeling miserable over the huge amount of cardio they needed to do; <br>
                                2. A mutual friend in a group chat was bothered by people's comments about her strong and lean legs being "too big", and was trying to run if off by clocking extra KMs; <br>
                                3. A video about girls chatting about their experiences with eating disorders and their state of mind now while recovering; <br>
                                4. Another girl on a podcast mentioned her embarrassment to show any part of her body, tummy and legs, and worried about people judging her body "imperfections" as a coach;<br>
                                5. Some old photos on my phone â€”></p>

                        <h4>Why do these matter? Why do these matter to me, you or anyone? </h4>

                            <p>1. I've been through extreme diets before, just to lose another one or two extra pounds, or for the number on the weighing machine to look good / "optimal" / smaller. <br>
                            2. While I used to be slightly underweight and slim, i still received comments about my legs being too strong, and i kept believing that, and kept trying to run more to burn my genes off. <br>
                            3. The extreme diet in 1 & the over exercising in 2 resulted in emotional instability & binge eating disorder over couple of years. Without being too specific, my heaviest weight (2019) was 153% heavier than my slimmest (2011) (at around the current height, i think i grew 1cm taller over the past few years). My eating disorder remains unstable and on & off; and my weight now fluctuates slightly below the heaviest mark. <br>
                            4. Over the years i started training in the gym, lifting, did couple of spartans races, long distance runs, started doing CrossFit, got a PT cert, wellness cert, CF level 1 cert, part timed as group trainer... My fitness routine remained active, various & regular; I am stronger (well, heavier too) than some of my guy friends, and i am proud of what my body is capable of after exercises. However. However. The 150% weight gain is not pure muscles. I have a rather noticeable bulge on my tummy that I constantly trying to hide. My thighs are thicker than usual. The fat layers on my back start to fight each other when i try to back bend or stretch... and those are the things my focus is on, most of the times. And i am, till this day, embarrassed to show my body with the fear of being judged by people, especially as a coach / fitness manic. <br>
                            5. And i was browsing through some old photos on my phone. (initially with a brief thought of whether i should update one of the social media profile pic). And i stumbled upon a sudden realization.</p>
                            <p>
                                No its not a photo of the "chopstick" me in year 2011. Not a photo of the one-time noticeable abs nor a triumph with my lean body after races. <br>

                                It was photos of my last summer's trip. A summer camp to the U.S. (I've graduated for 4 years now. This was a passion trip. Maybe I'll write about this in the future.) It was couple of photos of me being with my new friends there. <br>

                                I think partially because it was a superb and remarkable experience that i would never forget about. While looking at the photos, I realized that there's a feeling of appreciation, joy and fulfillment in my heart that start to rise; there's also a tiny trace of bitterness that the happy time has past. I looked at my face in those photos, and i thought "hell i looked happy". <br>

                                And so I stumbled upon this sudden realization, that truly, the "perfect weight/physique" doesn't exist; that i have been constantly pursuing something and being so obsessed with it that the mind and body go to the extremes. Yet no matter how small or "perfect" we think the weight should be, it does not, has never and will never bring us the level of joy as a fulfilling experience such as exchanging ideas with a bunch of smart friends, winning a small competition with like-minded & -bodied strong people, or completing an ultra trail, Spartan Trifecta, or an unprepared Marathon. <br>

                                The pursuit and the obsession is meaningless. Judging people by the number on the scale, or even the number by their birth years, is also crude, ignorant and meaningless. Does a higher IQ makes someone a better person? Does one being younger, older, heavier, lighter has anything to do with one as a person? Those are just tags on our packaging. Does the number of grams on a chips package change the flavor or nutritional content of that chip? Guess not. We're smart enough to not judge a bag of chips by its packaging, and yet we're so held up on what's lying on the surface of ourselves. <br>

                                Its the flavor that matters. The unique experiences, different perspectives, willingness of taking control of what one enjoys to do, and the courage to pursue what one loves. We feel the spark of joy from those moments in life, moments that trespasses weight, gender, age, and all the stereotypical tags this society put on us. And we should learn to not let the imperfections affect who we are and what brings us true happiness. Learn to love the imperfections. This is something I will, and hopefully you will too, practice more and more in our lives.<br>
